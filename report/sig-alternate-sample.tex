% This is "sig-alternate.tex" V2.1 April 2013
% This file should be compiled with V2.5 of "sig-alternate.cls" May 2012
%
% This example file demonstrates the use of the 'sig-alternate.cls'
% V2.5 LaTeX2e document class file. It is for those submitting
% articles to ACM Conference Proceedings WHO DO NOT WISH TO
% STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE SIGS (PUBS-BOARD-ENDORSED) STYLE.
% The 'sig-alternate.cls' file will produce a similar-looking,
% albeit, 'tighter' paper resulting in, invariably, fewer pages.
%
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V2.5) produces:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) NO page numbers
%
% as against the acm_proc_article-sp.cls file which
% DOES NOT produce 1) thru' 3) above.
%
% Using 'sig-alternate.cls' you have control, however, from within
% the source .tex file, over both the CopyrightYear
% (defaulted to 200X) and the ACM Copyright Data
% (defaulted to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX).
% e.g.
% \CopyrightYear{2007} will cause 2007 to appear in the copyright line.
% \crdata{0-12345-67-8/90/12} will cause 0-12345-67-8/90/12 to appear in the copyright line.

% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex source is an example which *does* use
% the .bib file (from which the .bbl file % is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission, you *NEED* to 'insert'
% your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide

\section{Introduction}
The main objective is to analyze a user’s political leaning based on his posts. With vector space model, we treat query (user’s posts) and documents (political parties’ posts) as vectors. Then we can analyze user’s political leaning with distance or similarity between their vectors.

Another important assumption is that posts about different topic may come from different language model. If we treat them as a large vector, it’s unreasonable that a post can contain various topics. As a result, we will classify documents and user’s query into different topics, creating a vector space model in each topic.

\section{Implementation}

The whole algorithm is basically a multi-class classification algorithm, with the political parties as classes. Most of time, text classification problem is simply applied with some linear classification techniques e.g. linear SVM. But here we think that since each document has its own topic like talking about gay-marriage.

The assumption we make here is that documents about different topic may come from different language model. So what we do first is to partition our documents into different topics by clustering algorithm. Then we train classifiers for each different topic base on the documents of the topic.

For a query (a user) , we treat it as a set of documents. Then we classify each document of that set (user) , aggregate the result and turns it into the result for that user.

\subsection{Cluster Data Into Different Topics}

The first job we have to do is to cluster data into different topics. We use \textit{K-Means Clustering} to separate them into 12 different topics. The motivation of clustering data is: for documents with various topics, we assume they are generated from different language models.

For instance, a document about homosexuality is irrelative to capital punishment, and we’ll assume it is generated from homosexuality model.

\subsection{Build Bigram Vector Space Model}

For each topic, we build a bigram vector space model based on data in the cluster. Thus, for a new document in this topic, we can measure it as a vector.

This model is based on \textit{TF-IDF} and \textit{Okapi BM25} smoothing method.

\large
\begin{itemize}
   \item  $TF_{doc}(term) = \log(\frac{total\ docs-docfreq(term) + 0.5}{docfreq(term) + 0.5})$


\item $IDF_{doc}(term) = \frac{c(term,doc)(k+1)}{c(term,doc)+k(1-b+b \times \frac{doc}{avgdoclen})}$

\item $TFIDF_{doc}(term) = TF_{doc}(term) \times IDF_{doc}(term)$
\end{itemize}
\normalsize
where $c(term, doc)$ is the term frequency in document $doc$.

In this project, the parameters $(k, b)$ are $(1.6, 0.75)$.


\subsection{Measure Posts From Known Parties}

For a post from a known party, we first determine which topics it discusses about, and measure it in the corresponding vector space model. This vector will be labeled to the specific party.

As a result, there are lots of labeled vectors in each topic model. They will be used to analyze user's political leanings.

\subsection{Analyze User Political Leanings}

To analyze a user's political leaning, we first have to extract the user's information. Here we treat each user as a set of vectors $\{d\}$ , where each vector representing a post/article/document he wrote.

Then we use our algorithm above to estimate the probability $Pr( x \text{ is similar to posts of political party } y \| x , \theta )$ of each post it wrote. But it remains an issue \: what is the political leaning of that user given his post's political bias ?

Here we just average all political bias of its posts and treat it as the political leaning of that user. Next, we apply \textit{K-Nearest Neighbors} algorithm to find k-nearest vectors (\textit{logistic regression} is also used) with \textit{cosine similarity}. Finally, we make k-nearest vectors to "vote" political leanings of user's posts.

\subsection{Active Learning}

One more issue remains : what if that user don't post a lot?

Here we use an active-learning-flavored idea : provide several posts from out data set and make the user to choose which it identify with. The post the user choose can be seen as the post it wrote. And the extended user posts set is then applied with our algorithm to figure out the political leaning.

\section{Result}

The ground truth of a person's political leanings is hard to define. Hence, we estimate legislators' political leanings of different known parties. The results shown in \textit{table 1} are estimated probability of having political leaning similar to some party. The parties used to build model are 國民黨, 民進黨, 時代力量, 親民黨, 綠黨, 社會民主黨.

For active learning, users have to make choice of their preferred document. This is usually determinative bacause the document has already been labeled to a political party. As a result, when the input data is insufficient, this active-learning-flavored model works well.

\section{Conclusion}

In most case, if the user input is sufficient and highly related to politics, the political leanings we predict is very precise. However, if user tends to post neutral and ambiguous remarks, or the input is insufficient, the precision will be limited. That is, the result is highly sensitive to user's input data. When user's posts are unbiased, there are too many documents considered similar.

Users' choice of documents is determinative when input data is not enough. Nevertheless, users' preferred documents may be not representative of his opinion. To summarize, the quantity of the user's posts are more important than his choice, which reveals his "true opinion" to some degree.
